## Lab Question Answers

Question 1: What are the denominations of the US coins from the green, blue, and
orange distributions? Can you think why the coins from the same denomination might show variation in
weight, although they are specified to be of the same weight? If your vending machine had a weight sensor, how would you use the weight of a coin that was just inserted to find the denomination?

The green distribution present pennies, the blue distribution represents nickels, and the orange distribution represents one dollar coins. The same denomination might show variation due to dirt/chips on the coin, causing them to vary in weight. If the vending machine had a weight sensor, I would weigh the coin and see which mean coin weight that coin is closest to to determine its value.

Question 2: We can shine light on the coin and measure the reflected amount of light,
which should be proportional (directly or in some non-linear way) to the size/area of the
coin. Can you guess which sensor on the Grove Pi Kit can be used for this purpose?

We can use the light sensor in the GrovePi kit to determine the amount of reflected light.

Question 3: Which of the following datasets are linearly separable? Justify your answer.
Figures A, B, C, and D are linearly separable because the two groups can be separated by a single line. Figures E and F are not linearly separable as a line cannot separate the datasets well.

Question 4. Sometimes we need more than a simple hyperplane to separate the
datasets of the two classes. What are some other simple geometric entities other than a
simple plane/line that can be used to separate some of the data points that were not
linearly separable?

We can use non-linear curves/planes, such as polynomials (dataset E), exponential functions, circles (for dataset F), etc. to separate datapoints.

Question 5. For the example shown in the figure, what is approximately the output of the
neuron?
The bias is -2 [if anybody has any confusion]

The output of the neuron is 0.982.
